### Built with

- CSS custom properties

I  want to continue learning on how to use bootstrap efficiently and easily.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools Bootstrap](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_ver.asp) - This helped me in styling my components and making them responsive. I really liked how they explain and give examples, so I'll continue using it.
